I am an experimental physicist passionate about quantum physics. My research interests include optical spectroscopy, semiconductor nanotechnology, and quantum optics. I am currently a Tenure-track Assistant Professor (RTT) at the [Physics Department](https://www.fisi.polimi.it/en) of the Politecnico di Milano.

## My research

My current research activities mainly focus on the study, optimization, and application of quantum dots as single and entangled photon sources. Using this technology, I have successfully worked on the implementation of ubiquitous quantum communication protocols, such as quantum teleportation, entanglement swapping, and quantum key distribution. I believe that combining key advances in materials and quantum information science offers great prospects: one of the goals of my research is to show that the introduction of novel photon sources in combination with steady experimental development leads to original contributions to the field of quantum optics.

## My background

I received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in Physics from the University of Milan in 2014 and the Ph.D. degree in Materials Science and Nanotechnology in 2018 from the University of Milano-Bicocca. During my Ph.D., I worked in the [Laboratory of Semiconductor Spectroscopy](https://lassem.mater.unimib.it/) in active collaboration with the interuniversity center L-NESS in Como and the Johannes Kepler University in Linz (8-month research period abroad). From 2018 to 2022, I worked as a postdoctoral researcher at the Physics Department of the Sapienza University of Rome in the [Nanophotonics group](https://trotta-nanophotonics.weebly.com/) lead by Prof. Rinaldo Trotta on research projects funded first by the ERC Starting Grant SPQRel and then by the FET Open Qurope. After that, I was promoted to a three-year Researcher position (RTDa) funded by the Sapienza University of Rome for teaching and research activities inherent to the experimental condensed matter physics division.

## Projects and collaborations

During my time as a Researcher, I have been involved in several national and international research projects:  FET Open Qurope, Quantera QD-E-QKD, Rome Technopole Flagship Project 5 (co-PI role), CN1 - Centro Nazionale di Ricerca HPC - Big data e Quantum Computing - Spoke 10, National Quantum Science and Technology Institute Spoke 4, QUID (Quantum Italy Deployment) European Quantum Communication Infrastructure, EPIQUE European Photonic Quantum Computer.
Throughout these years, I had the opportunity to collaborate with partners from many institutions across Europe:  Johannes Kepler University Linz (Prof. Armando Rastelli), University of Paderborn (Prof. Klaus D. Jöns), Sapienza University of Rome (Prof. Fabio Sciarrino), University of Milano-Bicocca (Prof. Stefano Sanguinetti),  KTH Stockholm (Prof. Val Zwiller), Tyndall National Institute Cork (Prof. Emanuele Pelucchi), University of Hamburg (Prof. Gabriel Bester), Würzburg University (Dr. Tobias Huber-Loyola, Prof. Sven Höfling), Palacký University (Prof. Vladyslav Usenko, Prof. Miroslav Ježek), Oxford University (Dr. Christian Schimpf),  CNR/IFN Padova (Dr. Stefano Bonora), qssys (Dr. Henning Weier), qtlabs.at (Dr. Martin Bohmann), Siegen University (Prof. Otfried Gühne).
