# Abstract

Two-photon resonant excitation of the biexciton-exciton cascade in a quantum dot generates highly polarization-entangled photon pairs in a near-deterministic way. However, the ultimate level of achievable entanglement is still debated. Here, we observe the impact of the laser-induced ac-Stark effect on the quantum dot emission spectra and on entanglement. For increasing pulse-duration-to-lifetime ratios and pump powers, decreasing values of concurrence are recorded. Nonetheless, additional contributions are still required to fully account for the observed below-unity concurrence.
